There are a lot of distractions in the world, and concentrating is hard. Every facet of technology fights for your attention and it's hard to stay focused. So we need an application to keep you focused.

However, most techniques and application implementations rely on yourself to keep track of time.

* Pomodoro Technique. It when you work a for a set amount of time and then rest for a set amount of time. Theoretically, it guarantees you to get some amount of work done since it a work-reward relationship. Caveat is the time you are spent working isn't necessarily your best work. You play against timers and can still wander away from your computer and look at your phone. Then you'd need an block phone usage and block websites. It's not very eloquent and nor is it helpful to establish a good work ethic by cutting cold turkey rather than weaning yourself slow off. Also, pomodoro isn't effective when you are productive and half a good work zone in place only to be cut short by the timer which does \(1\) ruin your concentration and \(2\) restricts you from working when you're in "the zone"
* Manic Time Tracker. It tracks all your application usage, but an application analytics is limited and doesn't freely provide any focusing tools.
* Website blockers. Blocks websites. Good when you know the exact URLs you shouldn't visiting \(gaming forums or websites\), but hard to fine grain. So there's an issue of accuracy.
