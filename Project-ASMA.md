# Mission

The mission to self motivate through the aide of a machine aide. There's alot of distraction in this world and self will to concentrate is even harder. The divided attention is the bane of all people in the technological age. Notifications distract and social media flutters through the mind. We all want to stay connected. But the idea is simple. Connect to one thing and one thing only. That thing being the program. Humans can only focus one thing at a time. It's much easier if something else helped you focus too.
